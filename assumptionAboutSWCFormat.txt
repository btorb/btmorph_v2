Soma Assumptions
---------------

From btorboist/btmorph_v2

On the NeuroMorpho.org website, 5 types of soma descriptions are considered (http://neuromorpho.org/neuroMorpho/SomaFormat.html).The "3-point soma" is the standard and most files are converted to this format during a curation step. btmorph follows this default specification and the *internal structure of btmorph implements the 3-point soma*.

However, two other options to describe the soma are still allowed and available, namely:
- soma absent: if the argument correctIfSomaAbsent is specified to be True, then it manually sets the type of
  the root to be 1 and treats it as if it had a one point soma.
- multiple cylinder: Converts it to a 3-point soma format with the same surface area as the multiple cylinder soma
  specified in the SWC file.


SWC Basic Assumptions:

1. A SWC file contains rows of numbers, each atleast 7 columns wide. Each row represents a node.
2. The columns are expected to be so:
        1. ID of the node, integer
        2. type of the node, integer
        3. x coordinate of the node, float
        4. y coordinate of the node, float
        5. z coordinate of the node, float
        6. radius associated with the node, float
        7. ID of the parent node of current node, integer (negative if current node is root)


Further Assumptions:

1. Contains atleast one root, and possibly more than one.
2. The first row need not be a root.
3. The parent of a row need not preceeded it.
4. IDs of two consecutive rows need not be consecutive.
5. Must not contain cycles.
6. Must not contain exactly identical rows.
